# Random-Numbers-Generator-with-a-given-distribution

The solution generates <b>integer random numbers with a given distribution.</b>

The distribution is given as real weights of indices. Unit tests are provided to check the correctness of the solution.

Examples:

● Input: [1.0, 2.0],

Output: 0 with probability ⅓ and 1 with probability ⅔

● Input: [1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0],

Output: a number between 0 and 4 with equal probabilities

● Input: [2.0, 0.0, 2.0],

Output: 0 with probability ½ and 2 with probability ½ (1 should not be generated)
